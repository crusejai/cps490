1. You need the html form for similar to registration.php
2. You need a file to convert form ids to elements used for a queries.
Like elementsConvert.php.
3. You need an file to include/ combine these files like reg.php.
4. You need a file to access/ disconnect to the database do the
queries to enter information and transfer to a different page after processing
the queries and ending the function(s).Like processregistration.php
